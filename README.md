We have seen these DRS being used in International Cricket matches but in local
tournaments or in gully cricket we have not seen such kind of technology. This
technology includes television replays and video processing.Most of us have played gullyDRS FOR GULLY CRICKET 2019-20

cricket and some people play local tournaments which are restricted to Taluk and district. When the runouts or catches are taken. Some decisions are confusing and tough. In
every such matches I have seen many fights happening because they think that the
umpire is biased and they think that he is not giving the right decision. One such event
had happened in my college as well. So after observing all these i decided to create an
App that is used to refer the decisions and to give correct decision. So basically this
project has a practical implementation as well. My project can be used both for big
matches as well as for gully crickets. A project that has real life implementation and a
software that can be used by all type of people in and around. In gully cricket we have
seen so many fights because of error in judgements for runouts and catches. But this
project is useful at those times. Human error is possible in Cricket but can be prevented
using my project. In gully cricket the team which is batting first, all the teamates will
be sitting without any work. So two of them can stand as umpires with mobile in their
hands. Now question raises like how to give decision onfield by the help of my project. My plan is to create a software as Cricket Assistance. Which will be application
basically that helps us to process the recorded video and give the decision. Here video
processing is one part and to show the output of my project i have used simple GUI. Basically using tkinter we can create buttons that will help us to process the video. So
this is very easy to use and at the same time easily implemented practically.
